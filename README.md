Hello GitHub!

Just a bit about myself; I'm an older "re-starting" programmer. I had 
a long "life-happened" hiatus after learning/writing Basic in 1993. I
had sporatic hints of programming in the military, mainly VB, VBA and
SQL that helped me but what really pushed me was finishing my BS degree 
in Computer Programming earlier this year. Not that the degree says 
anything special but it was the 6-week fast track classes that
refreshed my mind about programming concepts and OOP all over again.

Cheers!

Michael
