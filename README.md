Hello GitHub!

Just a bit about myself; I'm an older "re-starting" programmer. I had 
a long "life-happened" hiatus after learning/writing Basic in 1993. I
had sporatic hints of programming in the military (1992-2016), mainly 
VB, VBA and SQL that helped keep programming fresh in my mind. However 
what really assisted was finishing my BS degree in Software Engineering 
in 2016 and really focused in Java, SQL, VBA, .Net and not that the 
"degree" says anything special but it reengaged memories of programming 
concepts and OOP again.

Cheers!
